                <h2>History of Munnar</h2>
                <p>The history of Munnar is closely related to its plantation era. It is said that this region got
                    introduced to the outside world for the first time when John Daniel Munro visited the area in the
                    year 1870. During his visit, he fell in love with its unfiltered beauty. Since he had a great
                    interest in plantations, he thought this would be a great area to grow crops, especially the Kannan
                    Devan Hills.</p>
                <p>However, at that time, the region was under the control of Poonjar Raja. So, without giving it any
                    second thought, John Daniel Munro decided to meet the head of the royal family of the Poonjar
                    dynasty and got the land of his choice on lease for a handsome payment.</p>
                <p>In 1878, Munro, with the combined efforts of his friends, formed the North Travancore Land Planting &
                    Agricultural Society and started cultivating a wide range of crops like cardamom, coffee, cinchona,
                    and sisal. After trying several crops, it was found that this land is ideal for the cultivation of
                    the tea crop in the region. Later, all other crops were abandoned to make it a perfect land for tea
                    plantation farming.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the first tea was cultivated here by A.H. Sharp in the year 1880. After a gap of 12 to
                    13 years, James Finley & Company entered the tea cultivation area and purchased around 33
                    independent tea estates. In 1897, the Kannan Devan Hills Produce Company was established to look
                    over the tea plantation areas.</p>
                <p>Later, in 1964, the Tata group collaborated with James Finley & Company. The collaboration continued
                    until 1983 when all the shares and stakeholding of the Finley Company were acquired by Tata group.
                    Once it was done, the name of the company was changed to Tata Tea Ltd. After that, tourism began to
                    flourish in Munnar and it was greeted by travelers from different parts of the world. From then to
                    now, there has been only an increase in the tourism sector.</p>
